## Why I built it ##

I built this app as a medium to learn more in-depth about Webpack. I have been using Webpack for a while now with the help of contributed gists from our generous coding community, but I really wanted to learn what exactly my webpack.config.js file was doing for me. 

This was a great learning opportunity--there's still a lot to learn about Webpack, but if all of a sudden create-react-app disappeared from the face of the earth, I could still bootstrap the project from scratch using Webpack.
